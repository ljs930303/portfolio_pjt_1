# Portfolio project 1: Real estate (apartment) price analysis

This project uses Python and Power BI to analyze the correlation between variable factors - population, new house supply, unsold houses, base interest rate of Bank of Korea and money supply (M2 balance) in the market - and apartment price and price change rate.

The data can be filtered by region and size of apartment (square meter) and show each corresponding graph (trend) and correlation coefficient based on the filtered data only.
