# Portfolio project 1: Real estate (apartment) price analysis

This project uses Python and Power BI to help you see the correlation between variable factors - population, new house supply, unsold houses, base interest rate of Bank of Korea and money supply (M2 balance) in the market - and apartment price and price change rate as well as the monthly trend of those variables.

Interactivity of the Python and Power BI files enables you to choose which factors you would like to see the correlation of with the apartment price or price change rate.

You can also filter the data by region and size of apartment (square meter) and show each corresponding graph (trend) and correlation coefficient based on the filtered data only.

# This is how I worked:

1. Download raw excel data and save the files locally
2. Convert the files into CSV ("raw_data" files in this repository) so that they can be processed with Pandas
3. Conduct data cleaning and analysis with Python
4. Conduct more detailed analysis and presentation with Power BI
